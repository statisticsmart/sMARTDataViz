# What is data visualisation?

# What is data visualisation?

The **visual representation** and presentation of data to facilitate understanding.

Andy Kirk-

- How you are going to plot your data

- Building bloks of charts
    
    - marks: points, lines or shapes to represent data
    
    - attributes: visual variations of marks: different scales, positions, sizes

# What is data visualisation?

- Design decisions as a means for communicating to others

    - interactivity
    
    - Annotations
    
    - legend, titles, scales, caption
    
    - dimentions of the chart area

# What is data visualisation?

The visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate **understanding**.

Andy Kirk-

## The three phases of understanding

Perceiving --> Interpretion --> Comprehending

- Three different cognitive focuses

---

# Perceiving

- **What do I see?: Reading the chart**

    - What data is shown?
    
    - What is on x-axis/ y-axis?
    
    - What do colours represent? 
    
    - What range of values are displayed?
    
    - stepped magnitude judgement?
    
    - Where are the least and most/ average?/largest and smallest?

# Interpreting

- Translate what you see into quantitative and/or qualitative meaning.

- Reader's ability to perform relational interpretation

    - Are these patterns normal, expected or unusual?
    
    - What features are interesting?
    
    - What features are important given the subject knowledge?
    
    - If you do not have any knowledge about the subject your understanding stops after the perceiving phase.

# Comprehending

- What does it mean to me?

- What does one do with this understanding?

- Have I learned something I did not know before?

- Was it confirmed I did not know before?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(mozzie)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
autoplot(as.ts(mozzie$Colombo))+labs(x="time index", y="counts", title="Time series plot of dengue cases in Colombo")

# What is data visualisation?

The visual representation and presentation of data to **facilitate** understanding.

- Visualisers can control the output but not the outcome.

---

## Perceiving:

What does it **show**?

## Interpreting

What does it **mean**?

## Comprehending

What does it **mean to me**?
---

# The Visualisation Design Process

- In visualisation there is no such thing as perfect solution.

## Organising your thinking: What, for whom, why

- Stage 1: Formulating your brief

- Stage 2: Working with data

- Stage 3: Establishing your editorial thinking

- Stage 4: Developing the design solution

---

# Formulating your brief

- Planning:
  
    - What is the output format? (printout, mobile app, etc)
    
    - Audience (How much asiistant they need? How familiar are they with the charts?)
    
    - Time scale
    
    - Tools
    
- Purpose: 

  - Exhibitory
  
  - Explanatory
  
  - Expliratory

# Exhibitory


---
background-image: url('e2.jpg')

# Explanatory


---

background-image: url('e3.png')
background-size: contain



# Exploratory


---

---
# Main reasons for using graphical displays

- Present or explore data

- 

---

## Challenges

- Whether it will be understood as you wish

- Plots which are common in one kind of field may be unfamiliar to the readers of another research field.

- Choice of graphical form: The same data may be plotted in many alternative ways, which is best and why? 

- May look different in print than on a computer screen.
---
## Content, Context and Construction

- Consistency

- Proximity: place graphics on the same page or on the facing page

- Layout

---
## Factors influence the effective visualisation

- Scales

    - Simplicity

    - Granularity: relative size, scale, level of detail

    - Coverage
    
- Sorting and ordering

- Annotation (Overlaying information)

    - Highlight particular feature of a graphic

    - Guides the reader
    
    - Emphasizing particular issue
    
    - Overlaying (Statistical) information
    
    - Challenge: overlapping or cluttered display
---

## Factors influence the effective visualisation

- Captions, legends

- Positioning 
 
   - Same page or in the facing page, inconvenient to have to turn pages back and forth
   
   
- Size, Frames and Aspect Ratio

 
- Colour

   - Blends well and distinguish between different categories
